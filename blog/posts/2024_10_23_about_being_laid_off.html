	In the fast-paced tech industry, where companies rise and fail in a matter of months, layoffs have become an unfortunate norm. A few months ago, I became part of this reality when I was laid off.

For the past six years, I had the privilege of contributing to cutting-edge GNSS projects alongside some of the industryâ€™s brightest minds, leading to diverse projects such as providing an authentication system to Galileo, the European GNSS constellation to avoid being hijacked by Elliot Carver (check [this](https://pubs.aip.org/physicstoday/online/18634/Safeguarding-GPS-and-thwarting-a-Bond-villain#:~:text=Carver%20and%20his,war%20is%20averted.) if you didnâ€™t watch 007â€™s Tomorrow Never Dies movie yet ðŸ˜Š) or providing High Accuracy service to millions of users allowing them to position with precision under 10 cm. But one day, it was my turn. The project where I was rolled finished after three years of developing, testing, and delivering all milestones, allowing Galileo users to use these services nowadays, reached its conclusion and I experienced firsthand the impact of corporate restructuring.

After months of self-care, travel, and introspection, I realized that this layoff might have been a blessing. It was the push I needed to step away from a potentially toxic environment where micromanagement had become the norm. In most of the daily meetings, my manager and the team lead questioned every line of code, even the ones previously approved by the team lead himself.  Or my experience in the last months of this project, where I was promoted into an Operations Manager role (without formal recognition or compensation) being in charge of coordinating the fix of critical anomalies, acting as the liaison between teams to ensure timely resolution, and presented a detailed plan to my manager, only to be met with demands for immediate fixes, just to be the one to have the last word, regardless of the impact on team morale and work-life balance. Those were the days. These constant counterproductive demands took a significant toll on my mental health and overall well-being but looking back, Iâ€™m grateful for this experience, as it has taught me valuable lessons about resilience and self-worth.

Now, it is time to begin my transition to the world of AI/ML, applying my expertise in software engineering and my experience leading complex projects.

This is the next chapter of my journey, and Iâ€™m excited to share my experiences with the community. If you have any ideas or want to connect, feel free to reach out!
